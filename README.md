Craps Simulation 1

This project simulates the game of Craps by asking the user to roll a dice to get a certain interger. If the player rolls a 7 or an 11 they win the game. However, if the player were to roll a 2, 3, or 12 as their first roll they will automatically lose. If the player rolls any other number it is becomes their "point" value. The player then rolls the dice until they roll their point value, however, if they were to roll a 7 the player will lose the game.

Login System

The project mimics a basic login system of a website. By storing the username and passwords in a txt file the program asks the user if they have a username or password. If they do not have a username and password they will be prompted to create one. If the do have a username and password they will be prompted to login.

Rock, Paper, Scissors
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This program follows the simple rules of rock, paper, scissors. The user will type either of those 3 choices to the computer and the program will print if the user won, if there was a tie, or if the user lost. The program then stores each win a loss and print the results. A simple program I created to practice loops in Python.
