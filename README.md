Craps Simulation 1
This project simulates the game of Craps by asking the user to roll a dice to get a certain interger. If the player rolls a 7 or an 11 they win the game. However, if the player were to roll a 2, 3, or 12 as their first roll they will automatically lose. If the player rolls any other number it is becomes their "point" value. The player then rolls the dice until they roll their point value, however, if they were to roll a 7 the player will lose the game.
